  <h2>üìã Process</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Brew ~120 cups of coffee (start by 8:30am).</li>
    <li>

      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Hand out donuts.
      <ul>
        <li><b>You will need a second person to help hand out donuts for the first 10 to 15 minutes. Kenny is often willing to help, but you can always just voluntell some dad to do it.</b></li>
        <li>Donuts must be purchased before taking.</li>
        <li>Children should be accompanied by parents.</li>
        <li>Tongs/gloves recommended; they should be in the drawers or drying by the sink).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Check periodically that all is in order with the coffee and other supplies.</li>
    <li>
      Start cleaning up at 10am.
      <ul>
        <li>Remaining donuts go to rectory.</li>
        <li>Break down donut boxes and dispose of them.</li>
        <li>Clean up coffee percolators.</li>
        <li>Return other supplies to where you found them.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

  </ul>

  <h2>‚òï Coffee Brewing Notes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the water jugs for the percolators, not the tap water.</li>
      <li>1 cup of grounds per 16 cups of water (if you fear arithmetic:
        1.5/24,
        2/32,
        2.5/40,
        3/48,
        3.5/56,
        4/64).
      <li>Do not put more than two percolators on a given (set of) outlet; the current draw could trip a breaker (so I've heard).</li>
      <li>If you get the coffee brewing by 8am, it will be a lot stronger.</li>
      <li>To clean the percolators, rinse them out with water and scrub any remaining visible residue, if necessary.</li>
      <li>The percolator with plastic the faux-crystal top should not be filled with more than 40 cups; it might not fully brew the grounds otherwise.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>‚ÑπÔ∏è Other Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      If the school building is locked (and it probably will be), let one of the ushers know you are on coffee duty and need to be let in.
    </li>
    <li>
      Hot water for tea is optional (but appreciated by the few who drink it).
    </li>
    <li>
      Please let me know if anything is running low; I try to check every week, but I miss thing sometimes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Thank you and may God bless you for your service!
    </li>
  </ul>
