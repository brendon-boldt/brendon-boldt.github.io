        <p> Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good.  His mercy endures forever.  </p>

        <p>
        I am a Catholic, husband, father, philosopher, researcher, and wearer of a few other hats. Surname-wise,
        I go by "Miller-Boldt" personally and "Boldt" professionally.
        My current profession is pursuing a PhD at Carnegie Mellon University's Language Technology Institute working with David Mortensen.
        My research centers around meta-scientific issues in computer simulations of language evolving from scratch, that is, <em>emergent language</em>.
        This research naturally incorporates aspects of linguistics, philosophy of science, machine learning, natural language processing, and information theory.
        At the moment, I intend to achieve the following in my dissertation:
        <ol>
          <li>Descrying what aspects of human language emergent language ought to replicate in order to be useful for linguistics, natural language processing, robotics, and beyond</li>
          <li>Creating a well-defined metric (or set thereof) for quantifying these aspects of human language</li>
          <li>Illustrating how to organize individual research works on emergent language into cohesive, general knowledge about the field</li>
        </ol>

            <strong>Case Study: Deontological Ethics in NLP</strong> -
            Equal co-author with <em>Shrimai Prabhumoye</em> discussing
            specifically how NLP literature addressing ethical issues could
            benefit from taking a more philosophically rigorous approach. In
            this case we look at applying deontological principles to ethical
            reasoning in NLP.

        <h2>Other Work</h2>
        <p>
        Much of the work I do in philosophy also relates to computing, so if you are interested in the intersection between language, cognition, philosophy, and computers, definitely check <a href="philosophy.html">this page</a> out.
        Most of the philosophy papers are from my undergraduate years, and my experience since then has shed light on the shortfallings of these works. That being said, I think that is a positive observation, lest my intellectual development have stagnated!
