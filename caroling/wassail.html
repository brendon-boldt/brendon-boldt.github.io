<h1>God Rest Ye, Merry Gentlemen</h1>

<p>
[1] God rest you merry, gentlemen, <br/>
Let nothing you dismay. <br/>
For Jesus Christ our Savior, <br/>
Was born on Christmas Day; <br/>
To save us all from Satan’s power, <br/>
When we were gone astray.
</p>

<p>
O tidings of comfort and joy, <br/>
Comfort and joy <br/>
O tidings of comfort and joy.
</p>

<p>
[2] In Bethlehem, in Jury, <br/>
This blessed Babe was born, <br/>
And laid within a manger, <br/>
Upon this blessed morn; <br/>
The which His mother Mary <br/>
Did nothing take in scorn.
</p>

<p>
[3] From God our heavenly Father, <br/>
A blessed angel came. <br/>
And unto certain shepherds, <br/>
Brought tidings of the same, <br/>
How that in Bethlehem was born, <br/>
The Son of God by name:
</p>

<p>
[4] Fear not, then said the Angel, <br/>
Let nothing you affright, <br/>
This day is born a Savior, <br/>
Of virtue, power, and might; <br/>
So frequently to vanquish all, <br/>
The friends of Satan quite;
</p>

<p>
[5] The shepherds at those tidings, <br/>
Rejoiced much in mind, <br/>
And left their flocks a feeding, <br/>
In tempest, storm, and wind, <br/>
And went to Bethlehem straightway, <br/>
This blessed babe to find:
</p>

<p>
[6] But when to Bethlehem they came, <br/>
Whereas this infant lay <br/>
They found him in a manger, <br/>
Where oxen feed on hay; <br/>
His mother Mary kneeling, <br/>
Unto the Lord did pray:
</p>

<p>
[7] With sudden joy and gladness <br/>
The shepherds were beguiled, <br/>
To see the Babe if Israel, <br/>
Before His mother mild, <br/>
O then with joy and cheerfulness <br/>
Rejoice, each mother's child.
</p>

<p>
[8] Now to the Lord sing praises, <br/>
All you within this place, <br/>
And with true love and brotherhood, <br/>
Each other now embrace; <br/>
This holy tide of Christmas, <br/>
Doth bring redeeming grace.
</p>

<p>
[9] God bless the ruler of this house, <br/>
And send him long to reign, <br/>
And many a merry Christmas <br/>
May live to see again; <br/>
Among your friends and kindred <br/>
That live both far and near.
</p>

<p>
That God send you a happy new year, <br/>
Happy new year, <br/>
And God send you a happy new year. 
</p>

<h1>Gloucestershire Wassail</h1>
<p>
[1] Wassail! wassail! all over the town, <br/>
Our toast it is white and our ale it is brown; <br/>
Our bowl it is made of the white maple tree; <br/>
With the wassailing bowl we'll drink to thee.
</p>

<p>
[2] Here's to our horse, and to his right ear, <br/>
God send our master a happy new year: <br/>
A happy new year as e'er he did see, <br/>
With my wassailing bowl I drink to thee.
</p>

<p>
[3] So here is to Cherry and to his right cheek <br/>
Pray God send our master a good piece of beef <br/>
And a good piece of beef that may we all see <br/>
With the wassailing bowl, we'll drink to thee.
</p>

<p>
[4] Here's to our mare, and to her right eye, <br/>
God send our mistress a good Christmas pie; <br/>
A good Christmas pie as e'er I did see, <br/>
With my wassailing bowl I drink to thee.
</p>

<p>
[5] So here is to Broad Mary and to her broad horn <br/>
May God send our master a good crop of corn <br/>
And a good crop of corn that may we all see <br/>
With the wassailing bowl, we'll drink to thee.
</p>

<p>
[6] And here is to Fillpail and to her left ear <br/>
Pray God send our master a happy New Year <br/>
And a happy New Year as e'er he did see <br/>
With the wassailing bowl, we'll drink to thee.
</p>

<p>
[8] Come butler, come fill us a bowl of the best <br/>
Then we hope that your soul in heaven may rest <br/>
But if you do draw us a bowl of the small <br/>
Then down shall go butler, bowl and all.
